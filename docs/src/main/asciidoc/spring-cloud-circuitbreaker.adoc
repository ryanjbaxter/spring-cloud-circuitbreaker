= Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

*{spring-cloud-version}*

== Introduction

Spring Cloud Circuit breaker provides an abstraction across different circuit breaker implementations.
It provides a consistent API to use in your applications allowing you the developer to choose the circuit
breaker implementation that best fits your needs for your app.

=== Supported Implementations

* https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Netfix Hystrix]
* https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j[Resilience4J]
* https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel[Sentinel]
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry]

== Core Concepts

To create a circuit breaker in your code you can use the `CircuitBreakerFactory` API.  When you include a Spring
Cloud Circuit Breaker starter on your classpath a bean implementing this API will automatically be created
for you.  A very simple example of using this API is given below

====
[source,java]
----
@Service
public static class DemoControllerService {
	private RestTemplate rest;
	private CircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory;

	public DemoControllerService(RestTemplate rest, CircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory) {
		this.rest = rest;
		this.cbFactory = cbFactory;
	}

	public String slow() {
		return cbFactory.createReactor("slow").run(() -> rest.getForObject("/slow", String.class), throwable -> "fallback");
	}

}
----
====

The `CircuitBreakerFactory.create` API will create an instance of a class called `CircuitBreaker`.
The `run` method takes a `Supplier` and a `Function`.  The `Supplier` is the code that you are going to
wrap in a circuit breaker.  The `Function` is the fallback that will be executed if the circuit
breaker is tripped.  The function will be passed the `Throwable` that caused the fallback to be
triggered.  You can optionally exclude the fallback if you do not want to provide one.

=== Circuit Breakers In Reactive Code

If Project Reactor is on the class path then you can also use `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` for your reactive
code.

====
[source,java]
----
@Service
public static class DemoControllerService {
	private ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory;
	private WebClient webClient;


	public DemoControllerService(WebClient webClient, ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory) {
		this.webClient = webClient;
		this.cbFactory = cbFactory;
	}

	public Mono<String> slow() {
		return webClient.get().uri("/slow").retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class).transform(
		it -> cbFactory.createReactor("slow").run(it, throwable -> return Mono.just("fallback")));
	}
}
----
====

The `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory.create` API will create an instance of a class called `ReactiveCircuitBreaker`.
The `run` method takes with a `Mono` or `Flux` and wraps it in a circuit breaker.  You can optionally profile
a fallback `Function` which will be called if the circuit breaker is tripped and will be passed the `Throwable`
that caused the failure.

== Configuration

You can configure your circuit breakers using by creating beans of type `Customizer`.  The `Customizer` interface
has a single method called `customize` that takes in the `Object` to customize.
